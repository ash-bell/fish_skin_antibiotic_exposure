## Abstract
The presence of antibiotics in waterways is a growing concern due to their potential to disrupt the balance of aquatic microbial ecosystems. Fish, a vital component of these ecosystems and aquaculture harbour diverse microbiomes on both their gut and skin surfaces. These microbiomes play a critical role in host health, nutrient absorption, immune priming, and protection from pathogens. While research has extensively explored the impacts of environmental antibiotics on fish gut microbiomes, the effects on skin microbiomes remain largely unknown. This study investigated the response of the Eurasian carp (*Cyprinus carpio*) skin microbiome to environmentally relevant concentrations of antibiotics. Carp were exposed to antibiotic cocktails mimicking effluent levels (low dose) and a worst-case scenario (high dose) for two weeks, followed by a two-week depuration period. 16S amplicon sequencing revealed a disruption in bacterial community composition following exposure, with limited recovery during depuration. Alpha diversity remained unchanged, but beta diversity metrics indicated significant bacterial community compositional shifts. Antibiotics resulted in the enrichment of the genus *Arcicella* (Proteobacteria) and depletion of *Sphaerotilus* (Bacteroidetes) and were identified as potential bioindicators of antibiotic stress. Tank water microbiomes closely resembled those of the low-dose exposure group, suggesting similar and potentially predictable responses to antibiotics. No significant increase in antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) was detected, potentially due to the short exposure time, concentration or low initial ARG abundance and diversity. This study highlights the potential for even low-level antibiotic exposure to disrupt fish skin microbiomes, necessitating further investigation into long-term effects, the functional capacity of altered microbiomes, and the role of the tank environment in microbiome recovery. Understanding the effect of antibiotics on fish skin microbiomes and their resilience to stressors will help inform strategies to improve fish health in aquaculture and protect wild fish populations.
